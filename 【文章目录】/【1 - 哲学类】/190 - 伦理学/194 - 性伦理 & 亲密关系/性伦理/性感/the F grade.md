\#the F grade\#

It’s just some dates, no big deal.

Not everyone do it for the ring.

And frankly, it really shouldn't be that way.

A lot of them just went for the experience, satisfied with the possibility, however small it is, of getting something more permanent out of it.

if it turns out to be nothing more than an exhilarating ride, it’s fine, they get the experience and this alone is good enough.

whoever achieves this situation will easily have what Leonardo had. It’s a low hanging fruit if you make this far.

You just need to make sure the experience you are offering is enough for the jump.

And that’s not always about being sexy or good looking, or being rich.

it’s about being extraordinary, being legendary.

There are levels, you know?

there is “that guy is good”,
and there is “that guy is f\*\*cking good”.

Take the hint.

Whatever you do, don’t stop at “good”,

**BE F\*\*CKING GOOD**,

put your ass in the F grade,

and then you will get the extra part, if you are still into that sort of thing.
